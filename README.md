# Hiring-Process-Analytics
As a data analyst at a multinational company like Google, my task is to
analyze the company's hiring process data, identifying trends in
rejections, interviews, job types, and vacancies. I begin by addressing
missing values and consolidating columns for simpler analysis. Next, I
detect outliers and decide on appropriate handling strategies. After data
preparation, I summarize findings using statistical measures and
visualizations. My goal is to provide actionable insights to enhance the
hiring process and contribute to organizational success.
